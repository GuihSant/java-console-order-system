# Java Console Order Management System

## 📌 Overview

This project is a **Java console-based Order Management System** designed to demonstrate solid **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles, clean code organization, and real-world business rules — all **without using a database**.

The application simulates a small order workflow where users can create customers, products, and orders, add items to orders, manage order status, and view order summaries.
